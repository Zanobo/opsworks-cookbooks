# With md5-based references, you can set moderate cache lengths on CSS and JS

# Amazing.

# I probably want to deploy these to a cdn no?
# No! Cloudfront can pull from custom origin servers now

#
# The only case where this doesn't work is when someone loads a dated version of
# your page, cloudfront goes to fetch the file again, and it's no longer there
# because the md5 hash has changed and the original file was either deleted or
# on a different server. You could make the filename static, but then you lose
# the ability to easily invalidate older assets. That could be considered a
# feature.
#
# Also, once you start having a TON of servers or VERY large assets, it might
# make sense to only compile on one machine and sync with S3 as the origin using
# the asset_sync gem:
